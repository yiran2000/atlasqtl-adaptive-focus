Description: Adaptive-focus strategy of coordinate ascent variational inference 
    (AF-CAVI),a strategy that selectively updates a few instead of all parameters 
    in CAVI, can efficiently boost the scalability and computational efficieny of
    Bayesian hiearchical models. This package provides an AF-CAVI implementation 
    for atlasQTL, a flexible sparse regression for variable selection in large 
    predictor and response settings, based on a series of hierarchically-related 
    spike-and-slab submodels. This implementation allows for multi-trait joint 
    quantatitive trait loci (QTL) mapping at a scale of thousands of traits and 
    genomic variants, and tens of thousands samples. The atlasQTL model is 
    particularly designed for QTL hotspot (QTL associated with multiple traits)
    detections with a hiearchial structure.
